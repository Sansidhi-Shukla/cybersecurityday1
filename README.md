Day 1 of cybersecurity internship with elevate labs


Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports
Objective: Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to
understand network exposure.
Tools: Nmap (free), Wireshark (optional)

Hints/Mini Guide:
1.Install Nmap from official website.

2.Find your local IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

3.Run: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 to perform TCP SYN scan.

4.Note down IP addresses and open ports found.

5.Optionally analyze packet capture with Wireshark.

6.Research common services running on those ports.

7.Identify potential security risks from open ports.

8.Save scan results as a text or HTML file.


# Outcome: Basic network reconnaissance skills; understanding network service exposure.


# Interview Questions:

1.What is an open port?

2.How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?

3.What risks are associated with open ports?

4.Explain the difference between TCP and UDP scanning.

5.How can open ports be secured?

6.What is a firewall's role regarding ports?

7.What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?

8.How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
